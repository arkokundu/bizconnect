Course project for COMS W4111 Introduction to Databases

We are building an application that will enable 2 main things:
Help a business connect with other businesses/individuals
Help individuals connect with businesses 

Our application will take an inspiration from dating apps such as tinder, but cater to businesses & individuals. Businesses can match with individuals(freelancers etc.)/other businesses to cater to their business needs.
Individuals can also find opportunities at businesses they are interested in .

Once both the parties connect on our app, they can do a chat/video meeting directly on our platform , or it can be a physical meeting which can also be booked via our platform.

Data Plan
For our business entity, we will obtain data from the internet (kaggle/Bing data sets)
For the rest of the entities, we will generate dummy data from https://www.mockaroo.com/

Constraints
Age of a person should be greater than 18 years. 
Name column in all entities should not allow NULL values
Foreign Key constraints enabled on tables.
Chat messages can not be longer than 500 characters.
